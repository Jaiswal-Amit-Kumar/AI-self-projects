##### INTRODUCTION

**The relevance of this study** is underscored by the urgent need for effective,
scalable, and proactive cybersecurity solutions that leverage artificial intelligence to
address the complex challenges posed by modern cyber threats, particularly in the
context of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart home systems. As smart home devices
proliferate, they create a vast network of interconnected systems that can be
vulnerable to cyber attacks. For instance, in 2020, a security flaw in a popular smart
lock allowed hackers to gain unauthorized access to homes, demonstrating how
vulnerabilities in IoT devices can lead to significant security breaches. AI-driven
monitoring clusters can analyze data from these devices in real-time, identifying
unusual patterns or behaviors that may indicate a security threat. By employing
machine learning algorithms to continuously learn from user interactions and
environmental changes, these systems can enhance their ability to detect anomalies
and respond proactively to potential threats. For example, an AI-enabled smart home
security system can differentiate between regular household activities and
suspicious behaviors, sending alerts to homeowners when necessary. In addition to
smart home systems, cloud technologies play a crucial role in managing and
securing IoT devices. Many smart home solutions rely on cloud-based platforms for
data processing and storage, making them susceptible to cloud-specific threats such

monitoring clusters within cloud environments can significantly bolster cybersecurity
measures. For example, companies like Microsoft utilize AI algorithms to monitor
user behavior across their Azure cloud services, detecting anomalies that could
signify compromised accounts or malicious activities. By integrating AI with threat
intelligence platforms, organizations can achieve a comprehensive view of their
security landscape, enabling them to respond swiftly to emerging threats. Moreover,

1 **.2 Background in Cybersercurity and AI**

1. 2.1 Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a discipline of computer science that focuses on creating
intelligent machines that think and behave like humans. To intelligently solve today's
various cybersecurity issues, such as intrusion detection and prevention systems,
popular AI techniques involving machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
methods, natural language processing (NLP), knowledge representation and
reasoning (KRR), and knowledge or rule-based expert systems (ES) modeling,
which are briefly discussed in Sect. 3, can be used. These approaches, for example,
can be used to detect harmful activities, detect fraud, anticipate cyber-attacks,
manage access control, detect cyber-anomalies or intrusions, and so on.

The goal of this article is to serve as a reference guide for academic and industrial
professionals who want to work and conduct research in the subject of cybersecurity
using intelligent computing. As a result, in the context of cybersecurity, a strong
focus is placed on common AI-based technologies and their applicability in
addressing today's different security concerns. Overall, this article presents a
complete picture of AI-driven cybersecurity in terms of concepts and models for
intelligent and automated cybersecurity services and management via intelligent
decision making while taking the benefits of AI approaches into consideration.

1. 2.2 Machine Learning
Machine learning models (ML algorithms) may learn about various cyber threats in
offline/online mode using the pre-processed dataset given. In real time, or online
mode, the ML algorithms identify any symptom of infiltration (any cyber assault). In
this scenario, "machine learning in cyber security" is shown. Replay,
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), impersonation, credentials leakage, password guessing,

--- PAGE BREAK

---

session key leakage, unauthorized data update, malware injection, flooding, denial of
service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS), and other types of attacks
are all possible in the cyber space. As a result, we require some kind of security
system to identify and prevent these assaults. We have an Internet-connected
system (laptops, desktops, smartphones, IoT devices) that can be used to do
numerous online operations, such as online financial transactions, online access to
healthcare data, social security numbers, and so on. Hackers are always looking for
holes in such systems, and once they find one, they launch their attacks. Depending
on the context, several ML approaches like as supervised learning, unsupervised
learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning can be used to identify and
mitigate cyber assaults. It is up to the communication environment and available
resources of the systems to choose which approach (supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning) best suits them.

Benefits of combining cyber security with machine learning

Both cyber security and machine learning are interdependent and can improve each
other's effectiveness. The following are some of the benefits of their joining forces.

![Models_and_methods_of_artificial_intelligence_for_a_monitoring_cluster_image_19_3](output\77ebc015-55c9-4c20-8e29-3da8cc09c291\Models_and_methods_of_artificial_intelligence_for_a_monitoring_cluster_image_19_3.png)

- Full proof security of ML models: As previously noted, ML models are subjectto a variety of assaults. The presence of these assaults may have an impact
on the operation, performance, and forecasts of ML models. However, these
unwelcome incidents might be avoided by deploying specific cyber security
systems. The implementation of cyber security procedures secures the
working and performance of the ML models, as well as the input datasets, and
we obtain accurate predictions and outcomes [7].

- Improved cyber security method performance: When we employ MLalgorithms in cyber security schemes (i.e., intrusion detection systems), we
enhance their performance (i.e., improved accuracy and detection rate with a
lower false positive rate). As appropriate for the communication environment
and related systems, ML approaches such as supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning algorithms
can be applied.

- Effective zero-day attack detection: The cyber security solutions that identifyintrusion with ML models appear to be particularly successful for detecting
zero day attacks (i.e., undiscovered malware assaults). This occurs because
they do the detection with the assistance of certain installed ML models. The
ML models function by collecting and matching specific features; if the
features of a program match the features of a malicious program, that
program might be labeled malicious. The ML models can do this detecting
operation automatically. Thus, the combination of cyber security and machine
learning can successfully identify zero-day threats.

1. 2.3 Deep Learning
Deep learning is now one of the most active research directions in the field of
artificial intelligence, offering several chances to overcome the limitations of classic
machine learning approaches. Humans extract the characteristics in typical machine
learning methods. There is a distinct research focus—feature engineering. However,
deep neural networks outperform humans in feature extraction in massive data
processing.

Because of its complexity and self-learning potential, DL enables more accurate and
quicker processing. The success of DL in numerous disciplines, along with the
limitations of conventional techniques in cybersecurity, necessitates more research
into DL use in security domains. The use of deep learning in cybersecurity fields
such as cyberattack detection has been effective.

--- PAGE BREAK

---

Although deep learning approaches have been effectively employed in image, audio,
and object identification, they are currently used relatively little in cyberattack
detection.

The inability of existing cybersecurity solutions to cope with the growing dynamics of
cyberattacks, failure to detect new threats, difficulties in the analysis process of
complex events, and limitations of effective scalability due to increasing the volume
of data and attack are the main challenges that new cybersecurity solutions will face.
The primary strategy that researchers are interested in is the use of DL approaches
to eliminate these difficulties. DDoS attack detection, behavioral abnormalities
detection, malware and protocol detection, CAPTCHA code detection, botnet
detection, and voice recognition are all capabilities of DL approaches that may be
successfully applied in cybersecurity challenges.

1. 2.4 Cyber Security
The information and communication technology (ICT) industry has expanded
significantly over the previous half-century, and it is now omnipresent and tightly
linked with our modern society. Thus, defending ICT systems and applications from
cyber-attacks has recently piqued the interest of security authorities [22].
Cybersecurity refers to the act of defending ICT systems from different cyber-threats
or assaults [9]. Several aspects are associated with cybersecurity: measures to
protect information and communication technology; raw data and information
contained therein, as well as their processing and transmission; associated virtual
and physical elements of the systems; the degree of protection resulting from the
application of those measures; and, finally, the associated field of professional
endeavor [23]. Craigen et al. coined the term "cyberse- curity as a set of tools,
practices, and guidelines that can be used to protect computer networks, software
programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access" [24]. According to
Aftergood et al. [12], “cybersecurity is a set of technologies and pro- cesses
designed to protect computers, networks, programs and data from attacks and
unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction”. Overall, cybersecurity issues with

cyber-attacks and creating matching defense strategies that retain certain features
specified as below [25, 26].

1. 2.5 Cyberattacks and security risks
The risks normally associated with each attack, which take into account three
security variables, such as threats (who is attacking), vulnerabilities (the holes they
are exploiting), and effects (what the assault does) [9]. A security event is defined as
any act that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information
assets or systems. There are several sorts of cybersecurity events that might pose
security hazards to an organization's systems and networks or a person [2]. They are
as follows:

- Unauthorized access refers to the act of gaining unauthorized access to anetwork, system, or data, which results in a breach of a security policy.

- Malware, often known as malicious software, is any program or software thatis purposefully meant to harm a computer, client, server, or computer network,
such as botnets. Malware kinds include computer viruses, worms, Trojan
horses, adware, ransomware, spyware, malicious bots, and so on. Ransom
virus, often known as ransomware, is a new type of malware that blocks users
from accessing their computers, personal files, or devices, and then demands
an anonymous online payment to regain access.

- Denial-of-Service is an attack designed to bring a system or network to a halt,rendering it inaccessible to its intended users, by overwhelming the target with
traffic that causes it to crash. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks normally employ
a single computer with an Internet connection, but distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attacks employ several computers and Internet connections to
overwhelm the targeted resource.

- Phishing is a type of social engineering used for a wide range of maliciousactivities carried out through human interactions, in which the fraudulent
attempt is made to obtain sensitive information such as banking and credit
card details, login credentials, or personally identifiable information by
impersonating a trusted individual or entity via an electronic communication
such as email, text, or instant message, etc.

--- PAGE BREAK

---

- The phrase "zero-day attack" refers to the threat of an undiscovered securityvulnerability for which either no fix has been provided or the program
developers were ignorant [4, 28].

Other well-known security incidents in the field of cybersecurity include privilege
escalation [29], password attack [30], insider threat [31], man-in-the-middle [32],
advanced persistent threat [33], SQL injection attack [34], cryptojacking attack [35],
web application attack [30], and so on. A data breach, often known as a data leak, is
a sort of security event that involves the unauthorized access to data by an
individual, application, or service [5].

##### 1.3 Conclusions on the first chapter

AI enhances cybersecurity through **advanced threat detection** , **automated**
**responses** , and **predictive analytics** . By analyzing large datasets rapidly, AI
systems can identify patterns and anomalies that human analysts might overlook,
leading to quicker identification of potential threats. Automation reduces response
times to incidents, allowing organizations to mitigate damage more effectively.
Furthermore, predictive capabilities enable proactive measures against future
attacks, thereby strengthening overall security postures. However, the
implementation of AI in cybersecurity is not without its challenges. High costs
associated with developing and maintaining AI systems can be a barrier for many
organizations, particularly smaller ones. Additionally, the complexity of AI
technologies necessitates specialized skills that are often in short supply. There is
also the risk of **adversarial attacks** , where malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities in
AI systems to launch sophisticated cyberattacks. Moreover, ethical considerations
arise regarding data privacy and the potential for bias in AI algorithms. Organizations
must ensure that their AI systems are transparent and accountable, addressing any
biases that may lead to unfair treatment or security gaps. In summary, while AI offers
significant advancements in enhancing cybersecurity measures, careful
consideration of the associated challenges is essential. Organizations must adopt a
balanced approach that leverages the strengths of AI while remaining vigilant against
its vulnerabilities. By doing so, they can effectively safeguard their digital
environments in an increasingly complex threat landscape.

##### CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW

1. 1 Artificial Intelligence methods in cybersecurity
Information and communications technology researchers believe that information
security (InfoSec) is critical [7]. As a result, some research have sought to solve this
issue by using improved procedures and technical artifacts, such as malware
detectors, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), advanced firewall
configurations, and data encryption algorithms. Although some studies have stated
that concentrating on human behavior may effectively handle InfoSec challenges
[10], others have argued that doing so alone is insufficient [3]. For example, the
volume of data handled by most firms needs extensive automation [12]. As a result,
organizational security operations require an optimal mix of personnel, technology,
and policy management.
Conventional cybersecurity prevention methods rely on fixed algorithms and physical
hardware (such as sensors and detectors), making them inefficient at limiting
emerging cyberspace threats [10]. For example, the initial generation of antivirus
systems was meant to detect viruses by analyzing their bit signatures. The key
assumption of this idea is that a virus has the same structure and bit pattern in every
instance. These signatures and algorithms are therefore permanent. Although the
signature library is updated daily (or anytime the device is connected to the Internet),
the sophistication and frequency with which large amounts of malware are released
renders this strategy ineffectual.
This shows that advances in AI applications have enabled the development of
relatively effective and efficient systems for automatically detecting and preventing
harmful activity in cyberspace [3]. They have been chosen to supplement current
technical solutions because they provide effective standards and processes for
better controlling and preventing cyber-attacks [14]. Despite all of the advantages
that AI offers, the fast evolution of techniques makes it exceedingly difficult for
academics to determine the most effective strategy and its influence on cyberspace
security. There is little doubt that the prevailing opinion among InfoSec and
CyberSec academics and practitioners is that AI has enhanced organisational
information security; nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, these statements
are hypothetical and have not been experimentally supported. Most prior research
have either proved how their invention outperforms a set of existing approaches or
surveyed a sample of systems to compare their performance to theirs. In all
situations, the amount of selection bias is rather substantial. As a result, there is a
need for collected literature that provides highlights of difficulties, challenges, and
future research objectives in the domain.
As previously stated, existing research sought to examine the literature on
CyberSec. For example, Al-Mhiqani et al. [15] examined examples and events in
cyber-physical systems, detailing a variety of security breaches and proposing

--- PAGE BREAK

---

strategies to mitigate such breaches. Although their work gives valuable insights for
scholars, it does not address difficulties about AI progress in the sector. It is
restricted and did not offer discussions on the dominant approaches and algorithms
in the subject. Li [16] provides an overview of how AI has been utilized to combat
cyberattacks. However, the study was arguably not systematic: the technique for
picking literature was not defined and was potentially susceptible to researcher bias.
Furthermore, Li [16] fails to explore the patterns and trends that influence the
performance of existing algorithms.
Other scholars focused their reviews on specific sectors, stating that cyber security
research is oriented towards intrusion detection and industrial control systems. [19]
Lun et al. [20], for example, defined, categorized, and assessed cyber-physical
security systems, concluding that the bulk of CyberSec research focuses on
methods for detecting and protecting power grids. Leszczyna [21] evaluated
CyberSec standards for smart grids and supplemented existing research by giving
evidence to consolidate and compare current standards. Coventry and Branley [22]
and Kruse et al. [23] examined attack trends in healthcare cyberspace and
discovered that information theft and ransomware attacks were becoming more
common among healthcare organizations. They determined that procedures and
mechanisms for guaranteeing cybersecurity inside the healthcare industry are weak.
Dilek et al. [3] investigated AI applications and strategies for combatting cybercrime,
although their study cannot be considered'systematic' when compared to the
systematic review principles established by Kitchenham and Charters [18]. They
specifically omitted to describe the methodology utilized for study selection (i.e.,
inclusion and exclusion criteria, search words and phrases), the databases
searched, and the data extraction method employed. Furthermore, although
reporting and explaining existing AI strategies for preventing cybercrime, they did not
offer an overview of research developments in the subject.

1. 2 Machine Learning methods in cybersecurity

--- PAGE BREAK

---

Machine learning (ML) is commonly regarded as a subfield of "Artificial Intelligence"
that is closely connected to computational statistics, data mining and analytics, and
data science, with a specific emphasis on teaching computers to learn from data [82,
83]. Thus, machine learning models are often made up of a collection of rules,
procedures, or sophisticated "transfer functions" that may be used to discover
intriguing data patterns or to detect or anticipate behavior [84], which might play an
essential role in cybersecurity. The next sections explore several strategies for
solving machine learning issues and how they relate to cybersecurity tasks.

- Supervised learning
Supervised learning occurs when precise objectives are stated to be attained
from a specific set of inputs, i.e., a task-driven technique. The most often used
supervised learning techniques in machine learning are classification and
regression approaches [129]. These approaches are often used to classify or
forecast the future of a specific security problem. In the cybersecurity area,
classification techniques can be used to forecast denial-of-service attacks
(yes, no) or to detect distinct kinds of network assaults such as scanning and
spoofing. The well-known classification algorithms include ZeroR [83], OneR
[130], Navies Bayes [131], Decision Tree [132, 133], K-nearest neighbors
[134], support vector machines [135], adaptive boosting [136], and logistic
regression [137]. Furthermore, Sarker et al. recently presented BehavDT
[133] and IntruDtree [106] classification algorithms capable of effectively
building a data-driven prediction model. Regression approaches, on the other
hand, are useful for forecasting continuous or quantitative values, such as
total phishing attacks in a certain period or network packet characteristics.
Regression analysis may also be used to identify the underlying reasons of
cybercrime and other forms of fraud [138]. Popular regression approaches
include linear regression [82] and support vector regression [135]. The
primary distinction between classification and regression is that the regression
output variable is numerical or continuous, whereas the anticipated output for
classification is categorical or discrete. Ensemble learning is an extension of
supervised learning in which several basic models are mixed together, such
as Random Forest learning [139], which creates many decision trees to tackle
a specific security goal.

- Unsupervised Learning
The basic aim in unsupervised learning issues is to uncover patterns,
structures, or knowledge in unlabeled data, i.e., the data-driven method [140].
In the field of cybersecurity, cyber-attacks such as malware can remain
concealed by altering their behavior constantly and autonomously to evade
detection. Clustering methods, a sort of unsupervised learning, can assist in

--- PAGE BREAK

---

identifying signs of such sophisticated assaults by revealing hidden patterns
and structures in datasets. Similarly, clustering algorithms may be effective in
discovering anomalies, policy violations, recognizing, and removing noisy
occurrences in data. The common partitioned clustering techniques are
K-means [141] and K-medoids [142], while the well-known hierarchical
clustering algorithms include single linkage [143] or full linkage [144].
Furthermore, a bottom-up clustering technique developed by Sarker et al.
[145] might be applied by taking data properties into consideration.
Furthermore, feature engineering activities such as optimum feature selection
or extraction related to a specific security concern may be valuable for future
investigation [106]. Sarker et al. [106] has developed a method for choosing
security features based on their significance score values. Furthermore,
common dimensionality reduction approaches for such problems include
principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, pearson correlation
analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization [82]. Another example is
association rule learning, in which machine learning-based policy rules help
prevent cyber-attacks.
The rules of an expert system are typically created manually by a knowledge
engineer working in conjunction with a domain expert [37, 140, 146]. On the
other hand, association rule learning is the finding of rules or associations
among a collection of accessible security traits or attributes in a given dataset
[147]. Correlation analysis may be used to quantify the strength of correlations
[138]. Many association rule mining techniques, such as logic-based [148],
frequent pattern-based [149,150,151], tree-based [152], and others, have
been suggested in the machine learning and data mining literature. Sarker et
al. [153] recently developed an association rule learning technique that takes
non-redundant generation into account and may be utilized to discover a set
of appropriate security policy rules. Furthermore, AIS [147], Apriori [149],
Apriori-TID and Apriori-Hybrid [149], FP-Tree [152], RARM [154], and Eclat
[155] are well-known association rule learning algorithms capable of solving
similar challenges in the realm of cybersecurity by creating a collection of
policy rules.

1. 3 Deep Learning methods in cybersecurity
There are ten deep learning approaches used to detect cyber security intrusions: (1)
deep neural network, (2) feed forward deep neural network, (3) recurrent neural
network, (4) convolutional neural network, (5) restricted Boltzmann machine, (6)
deep belief network, (7) deep auto-encoder, (8) deep migration learning, (9)
self-taught learning, and (10) replicator neural network.
Tang et al. [21] suggested an intrusion detection system that uses a deep learning
method in software-defined networking. The suggested IDS system is integrated
within the SDN controller, which can monitor all of the OpenFlow switches. The
NSL-KDD dataset was utilized in the study under 2-class categorization (normal and
anomalous), and it was divided into four categories: (1) DoS assaults, (2) R2L
attacks, (3) U2R attacks, and (4) Probe attacks. The experimental findings showed
that the learning rate of 0.001 outperformed others with the largest receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC). To deal with large amounts of network data,
Potluri et al. [22] employed a deep neural technique as the deep-category classifier.
They employed the NSL-KDD dataset, which includes 39 attack types divided into
four groups. Their research demonstrates that with two classifications (normal and
assault), the detection accuracy is great.
Kang et al. [23] suggested an intrusion detection solution for vehicular networks
using a deep neural network. The attack scenario was carried out using malicious
data packets fed onto an in-vehicle controller area network bus. The proposed
system uses the feature vector to categorize packets into two categories (regular
packets and attack packets). The outputs are generated using the activation function
(for example, ReLU). The outputs are then connected to the following hidden layers.
When the false positive error is smaller than 1-2%, the suggested method has a
detection rate of 99%.
Hinton's landmark study [9] established Deep Belief Networks. They are a type of
DNN made up of numerous layers of hidden units that have connections between
them but not between the units within each layer. DBNs are trained unsupervised.
They are typically trained by altering the weights in each hidden layer independently
in order to reconstruct the input.
Zhou et al. [24] suggested a deep neural network-based intrusion detection system
to aid in the classification of cyberattacks. Specifically, the system contains three
phases: (1) data collection (DAQ), (2) data pre-processing, and (3) deep neural
network classification. The system achieves 0.963 accuracy for the SVM model
using a learning rate of 0.01, ten training epochs, and 86 input units. The results

--- PAGE BREAK

---

reveal that this strategy marginally outperforms the next three machine learning
approaches. (1) Linear regression, (2) Random Forest, and (3) K-nearest neighbor.
Feng et al. [25] present a plug-and-play device that captures packets and uses a
deep learning detection model to identify Denial of Service (DoS) and privacy
assaults in ad hoc networks. To identify XSS and SQL assaults, the proposed model
employs two deep learning approaches: convolutional neural networks (CNN) and
long short-term memory (LSTM). To identify DoS assaults, the suggested approach
employs a deep neural network. The KDD CUP 99 dataset was utilized in the study,
with 30% for testing and 70% for training. Furthermore, the study found that the deep
neural network and the convolutional neural network detected XSS assaults with an
accuracy of 0.57% and 0.78%, respectively. The ReLU function serves as both the
activation function and the stochastic optimization strategy for deep neural network
training. The suggested model has an accuracy of roughly 99 percent.
Zhang et al. [26] present a nice example of deep adversarial learning and statistical
learning approaches for detecting network intrusions. The study may detect a wide
range of network attacks by utilizing data augmentation and sophisticated
classification algorithms. The suggested system has two components: the
discriminator and the generator. The discriminator serves as an indication, rejecting
augmented data from genuine intrusion samples, whereas the generator generates
augmented intrusion data. Kim et al. [28] utilized the KDD 1999 data set to train a
deep neural network to detect ever-changing network assaults. The suggested
intrusion detection model has two parameters: four hidden layers and 100 hidden
units.

1. 4 Cyber Attacks and Types
Due of the importance of cyber hazards, several literature studies have been done in
this area. Eling (2020) analyzed the available academic literature on cyber risk and
cyber insurance from an economic approach. A total of 217 publications using the
phrase 'cyber risk' were discovered and divided into different categories. As a result,
open research topics are discovered, indicating that study on cyber hazards is still in
its early stages due to its dynamic and growing character. Furthermore, the author
emphasizes the need of information exchange among public and private entities. An
better information flow might help to evaluate risk more precisely, making cyber risks
more insurable and assisting risk managers in determining the appropriate degree of
cyber risk for their organization. In the context of cyber insurance data, Romanosky
et al. (2019) examined the underwriting process and demonstrated how cyber
insurers comprehend and assess cyber risks. For this study, they investigated publicly accessible American cyber insurance plans and looked at three components
(coverage, application questions, and price). According to the authors' findings,
many insurers used very simple, flat-rate pricing (based on a single calculation of
expected loss), whereas others used more parameters such as the company's asset
value (or revenue) or standard insurance metrics (e.g., deductible, limits), as well as
the industry. This is consistent with Eling (2020), who claims that more data might

--- PAGE BREAK

---

assist to correctly evaluate cyber risk, making it more insurable. Nurse et al. (2020)
did similar studies on cyber insurance and data. The authors investigated cyber
insurance practitioners' opinions and the problems they confront while collecting and
analyzing data. In addition, gaps were found during the investigation where extra
data is needed. The authors found that cyber insurance is still in its infancy, with
many unsolved concerns (such as cyber value, risk assessment, and recovery).
They also stated that a greater knowledge of data gathering and utilization in cyber
insurance would be extremely beneficial for future study and practice. Bessy-Roland
et al. (2021) reached a similar finding. They suggested a multivariate Hawkes
framework for modeling and predicting the frequency of cyber assaults. They utilized
a publicly available dataset including features of data breaches impacting the US
sector. In conclusion, the authors argue that while an insurer has a better
understanding of cyber losses, it is based on a tiny dataset, therefore combining it
with external data sources appears to be necessary for improving cyber risk
assessments.
Several systematic reviews have been published on cybersecurity (Kruse et al. 2017;
Lee et al. 2020; Loukas et al. 2013; Ulven and Wangen 2021). In these publications,
the writers focused on a specific subject or industry within the framework of
cybersecurity. This research contributes to the existing literature by emphasizing on
data availability and its relevance to risk management and insurance stakeholders.
Kruse et al. (2017) carried out a systematic literature review, focusing on healthcare
and cybersecurity. The authors found 472 publications with the keywords
'cybersecurity and healthcare' or 'ransomware' in the databases Cumulative Index of
Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PubMed, and Proquest. Articles were
considered for this review if they met three criteria: (1) they were published between
2006 and 2016, (2) the full-text version of the paper was available, and (3) the
publication was a peer-reviewed or academic journal. The authors discovered that
technology advancements and government legislation (in the United States) are the
primary factors exposing the health industry to cyber threats. Loukas et al. (2013) did
a review that centered on cyber hazards and cybersecurity in disaster management.
The authors offered an overview of cyber hazards in communication, sensor,
information management, and vehicle technologies utilized in emergency
management, as well as areas where no solutions are currently available in the
literature. Similarly, Ulven and Wangen (2021) examined the literature on
cybersecurity concerns in higher education institutions. The authors conducted a
literature study using the keywords 'cyber', 'information risks', or 'vulnerability' in
conjunction with the phrases 'higher education, 'university', or 'academia'. Lee et al.
(2020) did a similar literature evaluation, focusing on Internet of Things (IoT)
cybersecurity. The review found that qualitative methods to cybersecurity risk
management focus on high-level frameworks, whereas quantitative approaches
focus on risk assessment and quantification of cyberattacks and their consequences.
In addition, the research established a four-step IoT cyber risk management
approach for identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing cyber hazards.

#### 3.8 Clustering Methods Used

[Unsupervised Machine Learning is the process of teaching a computer to use](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/supervised-unsupervised-learning/)
unlabeled, unclassified data and allowing the algorithm to operate on that data
without supervision. Without any prior training on the data, the machine's job in this
case is to organize the unsorted data according to parallels, patterns, and variations.

Clustering methods employed in the study consist of:

- **K-Means Clustering** : K stands for clustering, assigns data points to one of Kclusters based on their distance from the center of the clusters. It begins by
randomly assigning the centroid of clusters in space. Each data point is then
assigned to one of the clusters based on its distance from the cluster centroid.
After assigning each point to one of the clusters, new cluster centroids are
assigned. This process is performed iteratively until a good cluster is found. In
the analysis, we assume that the number of clusters is predetermined and we
must place the points in one of the groups.

- **Hierarchical Clustering** [: Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-hierarchical-clustering-agglomerative-and-divisive-clustering/)analysis in data mining that creates a hierarchical representation of the
clusters in a dataset. The method starts by treating each data point as a
separate cluster and then iteratively combines the closest clusters until a
stopping criterion is reached. The result of hierarchical clustering is a tree-like
structure, called a dendrogram, which illustrates the hierarchical relationships
among the clusters. Method **hierarchical clustering** works by grouping data
into a tree of clusters. Hierarchical clustering begins by treating each data
point as a separate cluster. Then repeatedly performs the following steps:
Identify 2 clusters that can be closest to each other, and Combine 2 maximally
comparable clusters. We need to continue these steps until all the clusters are
merged together. In hierarchical clustering, the goal is to create a hierarchical
series of nested clusters.

density of points. ***DBSCAN Algorithm*** is based on this intuitive concept of
"clusters" and "noise". The key idea is that for each point in a cluster, a
neighborhood of a given radius must contain at least a minimum number of
points.
